			<p>used to shoot landscapes. They’re simple, straightforward, an excuse to explore the wildlands. But over time I grew dissatisfied. My photos were sloppy, riddled with imperfections. I wanted to distill the essence of the natural world.</p>

			<p>Now, I shoot wildlife. I don’t just want to capture the animal; I want to capture its world, put my subject in its place. The relationship between the creature and its environment is extremely important, and most photographers forget that.</p>
			<p>My work is all about enunciation: I have a vision, a specific way of looking at the world, and my goal is to show the world that vision. When the light hits the leaves in a particular way, I see it, and if I can get the viewer to see that too, then I’ve succeeded. I take advantage of small details: the subtle bends of tall grass, the faint red of dogwood, or the soft streaks of cattails. I compose not from my subject outwards, but from the environment in; this way, my photos are cohesive, unified, and tight. I seek oneness, a photograph coupled with an emotion, a vignette of the moment captured. I want to tell the story, large or small, of my subject: a grasshopper’s evening poise upon its domain of cattails, a deer’s rainy-day ritual of shaking the water off its antlers, or a chimney swift’s migratory journey over autumn’s dry, rustling cornfields.</p>

			<p>My work involves a give and take with nature. The ecstatic joy of discovering a downy woodpecker or long-eared owl or mule deer is what I receive from the world, but I have to start with a vision. With a story to tell I venture vulnerable into the woods and scoop up a bit of its soul. Photography is never passive; it’s a communion. In order to see, you have to stick your eye out into the bramble and hope that the world performs.</p>
